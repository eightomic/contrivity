## About
Spawn into the hostile quantum laboratory and destroy wave after wave of oscillations in this endless, top-down arena shooting game with a variety of randomly-selected weapons.

This game was designed as a fun, minimalist, relaxing shoot-em-up game to unleash carnage upon zombie-like enemies without stress triggers from challenging objectives, player death, realistic visuals or sound.
